# DealDigger AI

DealDigger AI is an intelligent deal-hunting assistant that scours the web to unearth personalized, high-value deals tailored to your preferences. It uses advanced AI and machine learning to find deals from major e-commerce platforms to local ads.

## Problem Addressed

Shoppers often waste time and miss out on the best deals due to the overwhelming number of online offers, especially those that are hidden, region-specific, or require constant monitoring. DealDigger AI aims to solve this by automating the deal discovery process and personalizing recommendations.

## Key Features

*   **Adaptive Deal Filtering**: Learns from user preferences (keywords, categories, location) to prioritize relevant offers.
*   **AI-Generated Deals**: Leverages Google Gemini to generate realistic deal suggestions when real-time scraping isn't the focus.
*   **Google Search Grounding**: Optionally uses Google Search via Gemini to find the latest, most current deals, providing source URLs for transparency.
*   **Deal Verification**: Utilizes AI to assess the authenticity and value of deals, providing a summary and a confidence score.
*   **Price History (Simulated)**: Shows a mock historical price trend for deals to help users decide the optimal time to buy.
*   **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and responsive user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter deals by keywords, categories, and location.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend**:
    *   React 19
    *   TypeScript
    *   Tailwind CSS
    *   Recharts (for price history charts)
*   **AI/Backend (via API)**:
    *   Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for:
        *   Generating deal content.
        *   Verifying deal authenticity.
        *   Grounding searches with Google Search for real-time deals.
*   **Development Environment**:
    *   ESM modules with `importmap` for browser-based dependency management.
    *   `process.env.API_KEY` for Google Gemini API key (must be configured).

## Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure all files are in the same directory.**
2.  **Install Dependencies**: This project is configured to use Vite. You must install the dependencies from `package.json`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **API Key Configuration**:
    *   This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function with its AI features.
    *   Vite handles environment variables securely. Create a file named `.env.local` in the project root.
    *   Add your API key to this file, prefixed with `VITE_`:
        ```.env.local
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   **Important**: You will need to update `services/geminiService.ts` to read this variable. Vite exposes it on `import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`, not `process.env.API_KEY`. You should change the line that retrieves the key to use `import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.
    *   If the `API_KEY` is not found, the application will fall back to displaying mock data and AI features like deal verification will be disabled or show an error.

4.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts the Vite development server. Open your browser to the local URL it provides (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) to see the application.

## Using the Application

*   Upon loading, the app will attempt to fetch initial deals using the Gemini API (or show mock deals if the API key is missing).
*   Use the **search bar** to enter keywords for deals you're interested in.
*   Optionally, provide a **location** to find region-specific or online deals accessible from there.
*   Click the **"Filter by Categories"** button to expand the category selection and check the categories you want.
*   Toggle the **"Use Google Search for latest deals"** switch if you want the AI to use Google Search for more current, real-world deals (this can be slower).
*   Click **"Find Latest Deals (Web)"** to initiate a search using Google Search grounding.
*   Click **"Find Deals (AI Generated)"** to get deals generated by the AI based on your prompt and preferences (without Google Search grounding).
*   For each deal card:
    *   Click **"Verify Deal"** to get an AI-powered assessment of the deal's authenticity and value.
    *   Click **"Price History"** to view a (simulated) price chart for the item.
*   If Google Search grounding was used, a list of **Sources** will appear below the search bar, linking to the web pages Gemini consulted.

## Notes

*   The price history feature currently uses mock data (`generateMockPriceHistory` in `geminiService.ts`).
*   Deal image URLs are placeholder images from `picsum.photos`.
*   The application prioritizes a clean, responsive, and accessible UI.
*   Error handling is in place for API key issues and general Gemini API errors.
